# Text processing project based on song lyrics 
## Corpus Description

This repository contains a small text corpus composed of song lyrics from four English-language songs: Heroes (David Bowie), Sleep on the Floor (The Lumineers), Sea of Dreams (Oberhofer), and Beggin’ (The Four Seasons). Each song is stored as an individual .txt file in the data/ directory and represents one document in the corpus.

## Intended Use and Audience

The corpus is intended for educational purposes, specifically for practicing basic text processing and linguistic annotation using spaCy. It may be useful for students or researchers interested in applying NLP techniques to song lyrics or popular music texts.

## Text Selection and Collection

The songs were selected based on personal preferences of the user. Lyrics were manually collected from publicly available online sources and saved as plain text files.

## Preprocessing and Annotation

Texts were minimally cleaned by normalizing whitespace and removing line breaks. Using spaCy the corpus was annotated with tokens, lemmas, and part-of-speech tags. The final output is a single CSV file. The Jupyter Notebook used, is also included in this repository.
