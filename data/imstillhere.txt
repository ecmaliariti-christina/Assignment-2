[Verse 1]
I am a question to the world
Not an answer to be heard
Or a moment that's held in your arms
And what do you think you'd ever say?
I won't listen anyway
You don't know me
And I'll never be what you want me to be

[Verse 2]
And what do you think you'd understand?
I'm a boy—no, I'm a man
You can't take me and throw me away
And how can you learn what's never shown?
Yeah, you stand here on your own
They don't know me 'cause I'm not here

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change?
They're the ones that stay the same
They don't know me 'cause I'm not here

[Verse 3]
And you see the things they never see
All you wanted, I could be
Now you know me, and I'm not afraid
And I want to tell you who I am
Can you help me be a man?
They can't break me, as long as I know who I am

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Wanna touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on, and feel I belong
And how can the world want me to change?
They're the ones that stay the same
They can't see me but I'm still here

[Bridge]
They can't tell me who to be
'Cause I'm not what they see
Yeah, the world is still sleepin'
While I keep on dreamin' for me
And their words are just whispers
And lies that I'll never believe

[Chorus]
And I want a moment to be real
Want to touch things I don't feel
Wanna hold on, and feel I belong
And how can you say I'll never change?
They're the ones that stay the same
I'm the one now 'cause I'm still here

[Outro]
I'm the one, 'cause I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here
