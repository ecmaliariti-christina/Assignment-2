[Verse 1]
I'll take your word
Like a good friend should
If the earth should dry
May your dreams never die

[Pre-Chorus]
Clouds are sacred, nothing!
The skies and all man, waiting!

[Chorus]
You'll find me
In a sea of dreams
Where no one cares about my words
I hear her voice
She laughs now
She loves me now and always did

[Verse 2]
I'll take your word
Like a best friend should
If your heart should dry
May your eyes still cry

[Chorus]
You'll find me
In a sea of dreams
Where no one cares about my words
I hear her voice
She laughs now
She loves me now and always did
